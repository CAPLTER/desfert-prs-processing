## processing notes

### fall 2021

Added a check to ensure reasonable range of deployment dates.

PRS data from fall 2021. These data include the full-suite of cation and anion analyses (i.e., are not limited to nitrogen species). Lab blanks were provided as 81A, 82A, and 83A; these values were edited in the original data file to 76, 77, and 78.

### summer 2020

PRS data from summer 2020. These data include the full-suite of cation and anion analyses (i.e., are not limited to nitrogen species).
